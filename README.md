# EnsModFramework

Welcome to the `EnsModFramework` package repository, a comprehensive toolkit for habitat suitability modeling. This package is designed to simplify the complexity of ecological analyses by integrating various modeling techniques optimized for environmental data.

## Introduction

The `EnsModFramework` brings together advanced modeling techniques such as Maxent, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Random Forest, and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). It is specifically tailored for handling climatic, soil, and topographic data in conjunction with species occurrence data, making it a powerful tool for both novice and experienced researchers in habitat suitability modeling.

## Project Status

**Note:** This project is currently under construction. The repository includes a limited set of functions and example code intended for demonstration purposes. We are actively developing additional features and documentation.

## Installation

To get started with `EnsModFramework`, clone this repository and install the necessary R packages as follows:
